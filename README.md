## Social Pressure

**Become accountable to your peers by publicly announcing and displaying the
status of your goals.**

*Use case #1*: I want to mediate every day and I know It would personally help
me (or pressure me) if I knew my friend John could pull up the status of this
goal at any time or be notified if I let it slide for too long. This app would
let me create a question ("Did Marcos mediate today?") and query the Todoist
API for the status of my meditation todo item which is then displayed to John.

*Use case #2*: I have a project I'm hosting on Github and I have a goal to work
on it at least 4 days per week. The app would check with Github every week and
figure out how many days I worked on my project this week.

*Use case #3*: I am doing well in accomplishing my goal, so when John pulls up
my profile page they'll see that all of my goals/questions are answered in the
positive.

*Use case #4*: I haven't meditated today, so when John goes to my profile page,
he'll see "Has Marcos mediated today? No." This is the passive involvement of
my social circle.

*Use case #5*: I haven't meditated in three weeks, so John gets a
notification/email/text telling him that I haven't mediated in three weeks.
This is the active involvement of my social circle.
